# HelmEye

## Project Overview

"Road Watch" is a computer vision initiative aimed at promoting road safety by detecting helmet compliance. The system utilizes a YOLO model to determine whether an individual is wearing a helmet. If the person is found to be without a helmet, the model then detects the vehicle's license plate. Future developments will involve accessing vehicle owner information from a database and building a basic frontend for result display. The project also plans to incorporate advanced motion deblurring techniques using Nafnet models.

## Features

- Helmet Detection: Utilizes a trained model to determine if a person is wearing a helmet.
- Number Plate Detection: In cases where no helmet is detected, the system identifies the vehicle's number plate.
## Future Enhancements:
- Retrieve and display the vehicle owner's details from a database for non-compliant cases.
- Create a simple frontend interface to present detection results.
- Integrate NAFNET models to minimize motion blur and enhance detection accuracy.
